# FashionMNIST_DCGAN_Keras
Deep convolutional generative adversarial network for FashionMNIST dataset with Keras and keras-adversarial.

I used the GAN architecture as in https://colab.research.google.com/github/sakethkaparthi/Apparel-GAN/blob/master/Fashion_MNIST_GAN.ipynb#scrollTo=hz1JhdX7EL5a (written with Tensorflow). 

To run the code you need to install keras_adversarial from: https://github.com/bstriner/keras-adversarial/tree/6651cfad771f72521c78a5cc3a23a2313efeaa88.
